// package stackmc implements the StackMC algorithm of Tracey, Wolpert, and Alonso.
// The StackMC algorithm is described in
//  Brendan Tracey, David Wolpert, and Juan J. Alonso.  "Using Supervised
//  Learning to Improve Monte Carlo Integral Estimation", AIAA Journal,
//  Vol. 51, No. 8 (2013), pp. 2015-2023.

// StackMC estimates the expected value of a function given a set of samples.
// It works by using a machine learning algorithm to construct a set of approximations
// to the underlying function, and using those functions as control variates
// to the original function.
//
// StackMC has been shown empirically to nearly always have a lower expected
// squared error than Monte Carlo sampling and using only the fitting function.
// This eliminates the need to choose between using the raw Monte Carlo average
// or the fit. This finding is a statistical average, there no guarantees of a
// lower error for any specific set of samples.
//
// The main routine in this package is Estimate, which estimates the expected
// value of the function given samples. For a simple use of Estimate, see [example].
// Much of the documentation of this package describes how to implement advanced
// routines (such as for research purposes), and will not be needed for typical
// users.
//
// StackMC works as follows:
//  - Partition the data into a number of folds (stackmc.Fold).
//  - Train each of the fitters using the training data (Fold.Training), and compute
//    the expected value for that fold.
//  - Evaluate the quality of the data in the folds using the assessing data
//    (Fold.Assess) to set α for each fold.
//  - Compute the expected value using the Monte Carlo samples, the fold expected
//    values, and the predictions of the fitter on the correcting data (Fold.Correct).
// In the standard StackMC algorithm, the data is partitioned using k-fold
// validation, with the held-out samples are used both for assessing and correcting.
// There is a single α for all of the folds, computed as discussed in the paper.
// The correction step is computed as
//  f̃ = 1/K \sum_{k=1}^K 1/|assess_k| \sum_{x_i ∈ assess_k} f(x_i) - α_k g_k(x_i)
//
// The above described the default procedure, though alternate procedures can be
// used through the AlphaComputer (setting α given the Assess predictions) and
// Combiner (combining the predictions and α to find the final estimate) interfaces.
